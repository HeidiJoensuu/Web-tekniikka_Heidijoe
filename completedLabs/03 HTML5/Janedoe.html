            <dd>I have many names. Some call me Nimue, others prefer me as Viviane or Nyneve.
                Most of the people know me as Lady of the Lake. My brother was murdered by Sir Balin
                and I will never forgive him. Also my greatest enemy is Merlin.
                The one who has as much as pover than I have.</dd>
